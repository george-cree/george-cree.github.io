I'm a cognitive scientist who uses neural network models to explore how the brain computes meaning from words, objects, faces, and people. My main current focus is on person knowledge and immediate impression formation (i.e., what knowledge is computed within the first few hundred milliseconds of meeting a new person, and how does our previous experience with the world shape those computations), but i've also worked on word meaning computation, and how knowledge influences object and face recognition.
